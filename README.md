# Assembly
I write raw Assembly code just for fun. I have:
- Text-based maze game
- Quick-sort implementation

## Compile and Run the assembly projects
- Install Visual Studio Code and the "x86 and x86_64 Assembly" Extension
- In Visual Studio Code, open the folder contains .asm files and masm.bat
- Go to masm.bat, follow the comment on line 4 and make sure you have the correct visual studio, crtlib, and uuid path.
- Open a new Terminal window. Type this line and hit enter: .\masm .\Source\[FileName].asm
- For example: .\masm .\Source\QuickSort.asm
- You will see an executable file and obj file, you can run the exe in visual studio code terminal or other methods.
